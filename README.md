# single-threaded-asynchronous-socket-server-client-in-C
It is a small project which has a socket server and a socket client implemented in C. More than one clients can be connected to the server and communicate with themselves (in the console, no GUI). Both the client and server is single threaded and uses asynchronous I/O to simultaneously read from or write into other sockets.
